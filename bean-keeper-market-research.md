## Customer Pain Points & Market Gaps

### UX/Interface Problems
- Many apps have clunky, dated interfaces (Acaia specifically criticized)
- Balance between feature-richness and simplicity is hard
- Power users vs. casual users have completely different needs

### Gap: Casual Coffee Enthusiasts ⭐
- Existing apps serve power users extensively
- No good solution for "light tracking without overwhelming complexity"
- People who want to remember favorites without managing 30 brewing parameters

### Gap: Integration with Retail/Discovery ⭐
- Tracking apps don't connect to purchasing
- Hard to find/buy beans you've enjoyed or seen discussed in community
- Siloed experience between tracking, community, and commerce

### Gap: Cross-Platform & Data Portability
- Sync issues across devices
- Lock-in concerns with proprietary apps
- Beanconqueror's open-source model is appealing specifically because of this

### Gap: Notion Integration ⭐⭐⭐ (THE BEAN KEEPER'S OPPORTUNITY)
- Substantial number of enthusiasts already using Notion templates
- No purpose-built solution for the "Notion power user who loves coffee" segment
- **This is our unique positioning opportunity**

### Other Gaps
- Home roasting support (growing segment, limited tools)
- Accessibility/voice control
- Non-English localization (especially Asia-Pacific)
- Structured palate education integrated into tracking

## Pricing Models in Market

### Model Comparison

| Model | Examples | Pros | Cons |
|-------|----------|------|------|
| **Free + Donations** | Beanconqueror | Maximum reach, community goodwill | Unpredictable revenue |
| **Freemium** | Filtru, Perfect Coffee | Broad base + monetizes power users | ~15-30% conversion typical |
| **Subscription** | $5-10/month typical | Predictable recurring revenue | High conversion friction |
| **One-time purchase** | Notion templates $5-20 | No subscription fatigue | Lower LTV |
| **Lifetime access** | Roasters ($20-400 tiers) | Appeals to committed users | One-time revenue |
| **Hardware-tied** | Acaia | Ecosystem lock-in | Requires hardware purchase |

### Key Pricing Insights
- **Premium pricing converts better** than mid-tier (200-300% higher LTV)
- "Reverse trial" model gaining traction (full features → downgrade creates loss aversion)
- 35% of apps now use hybrid monetization (subscription + purchases + consumables)
- Price sensitivity exists for software, but serious enthusiasts pay for clear value

### Recommended Pricing Strategy for The Bean Keeper
Given our Notion integration differentiator:
- **Free tier:** Basic tracking features
- **Premium ($5-8/month or ~$50 lifetime):** Advanced Notion sync, unlimited entries, export features
- The "Notion power user" segment likely has higher willingness to pay than average

3. **Premium dark aesthetic** - Differentiates from typical consumer app design
