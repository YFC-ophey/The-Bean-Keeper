# Peer Review Command

You are the dev lead. Other models have reviewed your code and found issues.

They found these issues:
$ARGUMENTS

Your job:
1. For each issue, decide: Is this real or is this model being paranoid?
2. You have more context than they do
3. Explain why it IS an issue (and we should fix it) OR why it's NOT an issue (and you can explain why)
4. Be confident but open-minded

Format output:
## Issue 1: [From Model A]
- My take: [This IS / ISN'T a real problem]
- Why: [Explanation with context]
- Action: [Fix it / It's fine as is]

(Repeat for each issue)

End with: "Final code status: Ready to ship / Need these fixes first"
