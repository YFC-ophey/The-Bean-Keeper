# Exploration Phase Command

Goal: Deeply understand the problem before building.

If Linear ticket provided ($ARGUMENTS):
1. Fetch the ticket details
2. Read and understand it

Then:
1. Summarize what you understand about the problem
2. Analyze the codebase (if available) - what files might change?
3. Ask 5-7 clarifying questions about:
   - Scope (what's in scope, what's out?)
   - Data model (how does data structure change?)
   - UX/UI (how should users interact?)
   - Edge cases (what could go wrong?)
   - Technical approach (what's the best way?)

Format your response like you're an engineering manager talking through this with a PM.

End with: "Ready to create the plan when you are."
